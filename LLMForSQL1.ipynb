Your task is to generate SQL queries that you must follow the following requirements: 1. Follow the provided database schema; no assumptions about other tables. 2. Generate a single SQL query, strictly compatible with SQLite. 3. Use ANSI SQL syntax suitable for SQLite. 4. Output only the SQL query, prefixed with `SQL:` and ending with `;`. 5. Do not include any additional text or questions. Below is the schema of the database, including the structure and column descriptions of 7 tables storing geographic information of the United States.
