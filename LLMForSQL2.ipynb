    "In this assignment, we will evaluate the ability of language on semantic parsing task. In particular, SQL parsing. The assignment has three parts:\n",

    "1.   Basic Prompt\n",
    "2.   Fine-tuning\n",

    "In each parts, you will exaime the model output in terms of correctness and output well-formedness.\n",

Your task is to generate SQL queries that you must follow the following requirements: 1. Follow the provided database schema; no assumptions about other tables. 2. Generate a single SQL query, strictly compatible with SQLite. 3. Use ANSI SQL syntax suitable for SQLite. 4. Output only the SQL query, prefixed with `SQL:` and ending with `;`. 5.
